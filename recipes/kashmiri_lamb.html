    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 dried red chile peppers (such as cayenne)</li>
        <li>3 long, green fresh chile peppers (such as Indian Jwala)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Kashmiri garam masala</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>¼ cup dried unsweetened coconut</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 pounds lamb meat, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon saffron threads</li>
        <li>whole blanched almonds</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place red chiles, green chiles, cumin seeds, garam masala, ginger, garlic, grated coconut, and tomatoes into a blender; pulse several times to chop, then blend into a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Stir the spice paste into the onion and cook and stir until the oil separates from the mixture, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in lamb pieces and salt. Cook, stirring frequently over medium-high heat, until the lamb pieces are browned on all sides, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in yogurt, saffron, and blanched almonds until well combined.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the meat is tender and the gravy is thick, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Garnish the curry with chopped cilantro before serving.</li>
    </ol>
